im pretty sure this isnt a good thing

but in case you care it runs in python3 so go download that
## shit requires **`requests`** and **`eyed3`** go get that too
install it with

#### `pip install requests`
#### `pip install eyed3`

then change the values in `catalogupdater.py` and run it, it shall give you all your soundcloud likes with its metadata sorted verr nicely ðŸ‘Œ
obviously it won't be perfect but that's because the people creating the tracks aren't
you'll have to go back in with itunes and fix some of them but it gets very close
it's a very successful and handy script and i've done a lot of testing on it recently
